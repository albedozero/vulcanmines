Type-in game from Compute's Apple Magazine 1987, written by Brett A. Painter. Abandonware unless I hear otherwise.

Used a hex editor, loaded these contents into a binary file and transfered to an apple .dsk file. Works great. Blast from the past!
Thanks original poster.
Loaded also original compute magazine that contained this program.
